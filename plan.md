Short-term

- DONE: Write tests for stack and queue [Aaron]
- DONE: Handle dynamic KCAS correctly [Aaron]
- DONE: Add postludes 
- and use them in MSQ [Aaron]
- DONE: Check that preludes work correctly with dynamic reagents
- `define` clauses [Sam]
- rethink `prelude` syntax wrt binders, i.e., only allow `prelude`
  as the first clause

Nonblocking algorithms to tackle

- sorted linked lists
- skiplists
- skipmaps
- hashmaps
- bags

Medium-term

- Blocking
- Channels
- CML API
- Joins API
- KCAS implementations

Blocking algorithms to tackle

- basic synchronizers
- blocking versions of data structure functions

Long-term

- Integrate with locking
- Full application, e.g. music synthesis
